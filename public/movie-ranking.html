<h1>The Best Movies According to me, ya boy Danny</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>I Love You, Man</h3>
<p>This is my favorite move by far. I can prettry much recite every line and I tend to quote it at least three times a week.
    This movie always brings me joy, it can lift me out of a bad mood or a deep depression. I would give this movie a 9.8/10.

<h3>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>This is probably one of the most nostalgic movies I can think of. Although many Star Wars fans would disagree, I belive this is the best Star Wars movie ever written. The deep dive into Anakins periously fall to the dark side makes for a great ice breaker at parties. 9.7/10 easily. </p>
<h3>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</h3>
Also know as JP2, this is by far the best Jurassic Park movie. This film is action packed from the second it starts, filling the dinosaur void you never knew you had. You'll be taken on an emotional journey of epic proportion in this epic sequal. 9.66/10, if you haven't watched it, then why?
